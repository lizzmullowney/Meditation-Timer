# Meditation Timer

Thanks for checking out my meditation timer project! I am so heartened to see that mindfulness has become more "mainstream" over the past decade or so, but I have found myself wanting a simple timer after entering decision paralysis with the host of guided meditations out there. This timer provides a nice peaceful background and a starting and closing bell.
